    5. Build from source - OS X

1. Install pre-built conda package (it's easy!)
===============================================
1. Install miniconda3. Download it from
    [here](http://conda.pydata.org/miniconda.html)
2. Create a new environment (named py34 here) and activate it:
    $ conda create -n py34 python=3.4
    $ source activate py34
3. Install Box2D from my channel
    $ conda install -c https://conda.anaconda.org/kne pybox2d
    Recent builds should be available for Windows, Linux, and OS X, with Python
    2.7, 3.3, 3.4 and 3.5.

2. The testbed examples
=======================
1. If using the conda packages, install a backend such as pygame to use as a
   renderer. I have packages for pygame and pygame_sdl2, the latter of which works
   better on OS X currently.
    $ source activate py34
    $ conda install -c https://conda.anaconda.org/kne pygame
    $ conda install -c https://conda.anaconda.org/kne pygame_sdl2
    
    Pyglet can be installed easily via pip:
    $ pip install pyglet

    Other backends include opencv and pyqt4.
2. Download the pybox2d repository to get the examples:
    [master branch source](https://github.com/pybox2d/pybox2d/archive/master.zip)
    Alternatively, if you have git installed, clone it instead:
    $ git clone https://github.com/pybox2d/pybox2d
3. Run an example with the desired backend:
    $ cd pybox2d/
    List all of the examples available:
    $ ls examples/*.py
    Try the web example:
    $ python -m examples.web --backend=pygame

3. Building from source - Linux
===============================
1. Download and install the latest version of SWIG (preferably 3.0.0+) with 
  your package manager.

  If you are using Ubuntu, you can install it via Synaptic Package Manager
  (package name 'swig'). You will also need to install the python-dev package,
  and build-essential (and python-pygame if you want to run the testbed).

  $ sudo apt-get install build-essential python-dev swig python-pygame git

2. Clone the git repository

  $ git clone https://github.com/pybox2d/pybox2d

3. Build and install the pybox2d library

  $ python setup.py build
  # Assuming everything goes well...
  $ sudo python setup.py install

4. Windows
==========

1. Install MinGW and then MSYS so that you can compile Box2D and pybox2d.
   Alternatively, install the correct version of Microsoft Visual Studio for
   your version of Python.
2. Install SWIG for making the Python wrapper. Install it in a location in your
   PATH, or add the SWIG directory to your PATH.

3. Clone the source from the git repository:
    $ git clone https://github.com/pybox2d/pybox2d

4. Run MSYS and locate your pybox2d directory
    $ cd /c/path/to/pybox2d/

5. Build and install pybox2d

    $ setup.py build
    $ setup.py install

5. OS X
=======

1. Install homebrew from http://brew.sh/
2. Install SWIG, which wraps the C++ library. From a terminal window:
    $ brew install swig
3. Clone the source from the git repository:
    $ git clone https://github.com/pybox2d/pybox2d

4. Run MSYS and locate your pybox2d directory
    $ cd /c/path/to/pybox2d/

5. Build and install pybox2d
    $ setup.py build

    Assuming you're using either Python from conda or brew Python,
    you should be able to install without superuser privileges:
    $ setup.py install
